# Testing System Implementation

**Date: 2025-04-26**

## Overview

Today I implemented an automated testing system for the Twine Template project using Playwright. This system allows for creating configurable test paths that can automatically click through the game and verify expected content.

## Components

1. **Playwright Test Framework**
   - Located in `/tests/`
   - Uses Playwright for browser automation
   - Configured to run against the compiled game in `/dist/`

2. **Test Configuration**
   - Located in `/tests/config/config.js`
   - Defines test paths as sequences of actions
   - Each test path verifies a specific user journey

3. **Test Runner**
   - Located in `/tests/tests/twine-playthrough.spec.js`
   - Reads test paths from the configuration
   - Executes each step and verifies expected results

4. **Just Integration**
   - Added new recipes to the justfile:
     - `install-tests`: Installs test dependencies
     - `test`: Runs the tests
     - `test-ui`: Runs tests with UI
     - `test-debug`: Runs tests in debug mode

5. **Rules Tester Mode**
   - Created a new mode for the Rules Tester role
   - Can only edit files in `memlog/*.md` and `tests/config/*`
   - Focused on creating and maintaining test configurations

## How to Use

### Setting Up

1. Install test dependencies:
   ```
   ./just install-tests
   ```

2. Compile the game:
   ```
   ./just compile
   ```

### Running Tests

Run tests with one of these commands:

- Basic test run:
  ```
  ./just test
  ```

- Interactive UI mode:
  ```
  ./just test-ui
  ```

- Debug mode:
  ```
  ./just test-debug
  ```

- Generate test report:
  ```
  ./just test-report
  ```

### Creating Test Paths

Test paths are defined in `tests/config/config.js` and follow this structure:

```javascript
{
  name: "Test Path Name",
  description: "What this test path verifies",
  steps: [
    {
      description: "Step description",
      action: "click|input|wait|assert",
      // Action-specific parameters
      expect: "Expected text after action"
    }
    // More steps...
  ]
}
```

### Example Test Path

```javascript
{
  name: "Basic Navigation",
  description: "Tests basic navigation through the game",
  steps: [
    {
      description: "Start the game",
      action: "assert",
      text: "Start", // Verify we're on the start page
    },
    {
      description: "Click on first choice",
      action: "click",
      text: "Begin your journey", // Text of the link to click
      expect: "You have chosen to begin your journey" // Text expected after clicking
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test Reporting

The testing system includes a report generation feature that creates a markdown report of test results. This report includes:

1. **Test Path Summary**
   - Lists all configured test paths
   - Shows details of each step in each path
   - Provides a quick overview of test coverage

2. **Test Results**
   - Shows pass/fail statistics
   - Lists failed tests with details
   - Links to screenshots for visual verification

3. **Recommendations**
   - Suggests improvements to test coverage
   - Highlights areas that need attention

To generate a report, run:
```
./just test-report
```

The report will be saved to `tests/test-report.md`.

## Next Steps

1. Create more comprehensive test paths covering all critical user journeys
2. Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
3. Integrate test runs into CI/CD pipeline
4. Expand test capabilities to include state verification
5. Enhance the reporting system with more detailed analytics

## Updates and Fixes

After initial implementation, I made the following improvements:

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Updated the justfile to ensure test dependencies are installed automatically
   - Enhanced the install-tests.sh script to be more robust
   - Explicitly added both `npx playwright install --with-deps` and `npx playwright install-deps` to ensure all system dependencies are properly installed

2. **Command Dependencies**
   - Modified test commands to depend on both compile and install-tests
   - This ensures all prerequisites are met before running tests
   - Prevents errors from missing dependencies

## Conclusion

The automated testing system provides a solid foundation for ensuring the game functions correctly. By defining test paths in a configuration file, we can easily maintain and expand our test coverage as the game evolves. The system is designed to be user-friendly with automatic dependency installation and clear documentation.
